# About me

I am a web developer and a space nerd.

After playing several hundred hours on KSP, and its numerous mods, I wanted to share some of my love
for this game with friends. I quickly realised that RO & RP-1 are hard to tackle alone, and the
available ressources about it are either outdated, hard to read, or hard-to-apply.

I decided to combine both my love for website building and KSP, and create this website. My aim is
to provide up to date, curated quality documentation to do anything on KSP RP-1.
