# Installation

The official instruction for installing RP-1 are
found [on the official wiki](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/wiki/RO-&-RP-1-Express-Installation-for-1.12.3)
but they are quite simple and will be summarised below.

## Prerequisites

1. Install a new copy of KSP _1.12.3_. It's the latest and probably the final version of KSP. If you
   already have an install of KSP, be sure to manually delete the folder
   in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Kerbal Space Program`
2. Install the latest [CKAN release](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/releases)

## RP-1

1. In CKAN, search for `Realistic Progression One (RP-1) Express Install`.
2. Press "Apply changes".
3. Click Apply to confirm.
4. You will be presented with a set of Recommended mods. You can let the default or edit that list.
   You can find a list of recommended mods in the [Mod page](/en/get-started/other-mods)
5. You will be presented with a choice of graphics level. Choose based on your computer's power
   level and memory. Medium should work for all but the slowest computers, or those with less than
   8GB of memory. If you have 16GB of memory or more and a reasonably fast CPU and GPU, select High.
6. Click Continue again and all your mods will download and install. NOTE this will take some time,
   especially for the High-Res choice which involves multiple GB of downloads.
