# How to get started with RO & RP-1

In this section, you will find how to install, setup and then approach RP-1. You will also find
resources regarding RP-1 compatible mods, or how to modify your saves.

## Prerequisites

In order to tackle the vast subject that is RP-1, you will need to have a good graps of the original
KSP game. If you do not understand the basics in orbital maneuvers, centre of mass, aerodynamic
forces... you will struggle to get far in RP-1. You don't need to be an expert, but some basic
knowledge will be required.

This guide also assume you are playing on PC as console do not have access to mods (_very sorry for
you guys_).

## Where to start

If it's not already done, you will need to [install RP-1](/en/get-started/installation).

Otherwise, here is a list of pages that might interest you:

- [Science Playthrough](/en/get-started/science-playthrough) enables you to play without worrying about tideous part of the mod if you want
