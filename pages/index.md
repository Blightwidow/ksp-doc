# KSP RO/RP-1 Documentation

This website is an open source project aimed at providing a solid documentation on how to tackle
the Kerbal Space Program mods [Real Solar System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/177216-18-real-solar-system-v1815-27-jun-2021/),
[Realism Overhaul](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155700-112-ksp-ro-realism-overhaul-16-may-2022/),
and [RP-1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/190040-rp-1-realistic-progression-one-for-ksp-1123/).

As these mods are complex and require some prior knowledge, they tend to not be very accessible. We
wanted to provide a simple repository of all the information you might need during your playthrough.
